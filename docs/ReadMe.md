ISSUES / BUGS: 01-28-2024
ran into an issues where I kept on getting an error when trying to makemigrations.
I kept on getting an error over the corsheader fixed this issue my downloading the pip package for corsheaders
second issue, kept getting an issue after creating the  "CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS" when i played a path after the cors I got a red warning. What I learned was the red warning popped because I had an additional forward slash which created the error.
